Out with my running group today we focused on working on our downhill technique. A few of the more experienced runners shared their tips and tricks for quick and controlled descents. If you have any other tricks to mastering the downhills, please add them in the comments!

### Short, quick steps

Keeping your stride short and your cadence quick is always important when trail running, but even more so when running down hill. By shortening your stride you’ll be lessening the impact on your knees, hips, and back. A shorter stride will also enable you to strike on the front of your foot, which provides a lot more stability than landing on your heels.

### Lean slightly forward

Fight the urge to lean back when running downhill, and instead lean slightly forward and let gravity pull you down the hill. Leaning back will be harder on your legs in the long run, and it will cause you to land on your heel. Like mentioned earlier, you’ll want to strike on front of your feet because it will give you more stability and will engage the right muscles.

### Scan ahead

When things get technical it’s tempting to stare at your feet to see exactly where they are landing, but that’s an easy way to get into trouble. You want to be alert to what obstacles are approaching, so work on scanning ahead and choosing the best route.

### Tread lightly

The less time you can spend in contact with the ground, the better. Think about being light on your feet.

### Use your arms

You won’t need to pump your arms to help propel you downhill, so like a gymnast to the balance beam, don’t be afraid to flail your arms to help maintain your balance.

### Be confident

Above all, be confident. Holding back on a downhill is more work than leaning forward and letting gravity do the work. So choose your line and just go for it.
